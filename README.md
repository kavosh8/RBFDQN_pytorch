#### RBF-DQN Pytorch

Implementation of RBF-DQN (see [paper](https://cs.brown.edu/people/gdk/pubs/deep_rbf.pdf)). 

For installation, use Python >=3.7 (tested on 3.7.9). 

Create a virtualenv, and use the included requirements file to setup your environment.

```
python -m venv ~/envs/rbf/
source ~/envs/rbf/bin/activate
(rbf) pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Note that CPPRB needs a different installation method on MacOS (see [here](https://ymd_h.gitlab.io/cpprb/installation/)).
